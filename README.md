# admin-page
This project from TheOdinProject curriculum deals (almost) entirely with grid layouts. The entire page will be created with a focus on grid, some implementations of flexbox, and an abundance of relative units. The layout was made with accountance for different device resolutions; it might not look perfect on VERY small screens, but doing so has taught me to always handle any possible implementation of my work.
